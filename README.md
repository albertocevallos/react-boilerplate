# React, Redux, Redux Thunk, SCSS, CSS Modules
Bundled with Parcel

## Minimal Boilerplate
* goal: write less code, build more routes & components
* opinionated file structure
* simple CSS resets

## Redux?
* only import state into components
* dispatch + hooks vs. actions
* generic redux utils found in `/util/redux-util.js`
* a slight "re-think" of redux and streamlining of files
